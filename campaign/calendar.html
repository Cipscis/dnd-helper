												<p>The party arrived in Lodiran by ship today. They each bought horses there, then everyone but Seilon left with High Divine Iluka's party.</p>

												<p>As the day passed, it became clear that High Divine Iluka had gone missing from Domilad. Divine Brock asked the party to rescue her, so they followed her to the spirit Minko and then to the Veridan Vault, where they fought through spiders to bring her back.</p>

												<p>Lucia saw glimpses of the temple's guardian, Morgain, and Mālwa heard them whisper "the man with the heart of stone" in his ear. When they found Iluka, Vyriel heard her whisper the same phrase when she saw Mālwa.</p>

												<p>The party argued with High Divine Iluka, who didn't appreciate their "rescue". She let slip the name of the Veridan Vault, but refused to give them any information or more than begrudging thanks.</p>

												<p>The party followed High Divine Iluka's group to the town of Dorinan, and from there went with their friend Durden to visit Master Kemma Izuras at Blue Lizard Fort, a temple occupied by the mercenary group known as the White Bear.</p>

												<p>There, they also met Arness and found that she'd trapped Toragad temple's guardian, Guvana.</p>

												<p><strong>7th of Red Moon</strong></p>

												<p>High Divine Iluka's party left Dorinan in the morning, travelling toward Gudaril where they would leave the main road for the Pilgrim's Path.</p>

												<p>The party returned to Dorinan from Blue Lizard Fort. There they retrieved the scroll that Dorinan's divine, Bara, had stolen from Arness. Arness wanted the scroll because it referred to the star that fell earlier in the summer, and had offered a reward of 1,000 gold pieces for it.</p>

												<p>Lucia convinced Divine Bara to give her the scroll, saying she would use it to bargain with Arness for Guvara's release. Once the scroll was in their possession, the party deciphered it to find it contained a prophecy referencing the man with the heart of stone:</p>

												<blockquote>
													<p>
														An end awaits for Toridal,<br />
														Passing out of seven's sight.<br />
														An end to priests, to prayer, to all,<br />
														Final fading of our light.<br />
														Once the north star leaves the night.
													</p>

													<p>
														The ancient world again will spread,<br />
														Paying blood to buy its throne.<br />
														The first unsealed marches ahead,<br />
														By their heart this herald's known:<br />
														The man with the heart of stone.
													</p>

													<p>
														We buried hope of our escape,<br />
														Hiding our forsaken kin.<br />
														The highest must undo their shape,<br />
														Taking evil deep within;<br />
														Become the eater of sin.
													</p>
												</blockquote>

												<p>They attempted to convince Arness to release Guvana in exchange for the scroll, but she did not agree. After leaving with the scroll, Vyriel came back in bird form and stole many of her notes from her library. This triggered a magical trap which alerted her to the theft. Although she doesn't know for certain it was him, he was observed turning back from a bird in Dorinan.</p>

												<p>The party caught up with Divine Bara on the road. They gave him the copy they'd created of the prophecy scroll, which he promptly destroyed.</p>

												<p>They initially decided to travel together, but then Vyriel turned into a bird so Bara could ride his horse. Bara was affronted by this blasphemous use of magic, and argued with them on the merits of using magic against accepting their place in the eyes of the gods. They decided not to travel together.</p>

												<p>The party then reached Gudaril in the afternoon, and chose to take the main road instead of the Pilgrim's Path. They hoped to reach Taramal ahead of Iluka's party, and decided if they needed to find her they could go back along the Pilgrim's Path.</p>

												<p>The party arrived in the city of Turuvan. They were followed by a young Sinless woman from the gate to the inn where the stabled their horses, who then took word of their arrival and whereabouts to High Divine Tiyan. Vyriel tried to follow her on the rooftops as a monkey, but lost track when she entered the temple and he had to find a secluded spot to return to his true shape. He asked about Mernivont at the temple, speaking to a young Divine called Aralya.</p>

												<p>Seilon found a library where, impersonating a Divine, he looked for information on the Veridan Vault. He found a book called <i>Ancient Vaults</i>, written by a foreign scolar, which pieced together legend and observation. It explained that the vaults were once prisons, and no prisoners left them alive. However, despite having located several vaults the author had been unable to enter them.</p>

												<p>Lucia uncovered the rumour that the caves where the starsilk is harvested are off limits, which is unusual.</p>

												<p>The party received an invitation to dine with High Divine Tiyan. They were guided to him by a pair of Sinless once they reached the temple.</p>

												<p>Inside, the conversation turned to the nature of the Sinless. Vyriel objected and tried to leave, and in response Tiyan started trying to manipulate the party's minds to stop them from leaving. The party objected, and Tiyan noted "I have not imprisoned you, yet".</p>

												<p>This escalated into a fight. Seilon blew up the door and, after a tussle with a couple of Sinless that ended when he shot one of them point blank in the face with fire-enhanced bullets, he fled. Lucia enlarged Mālwa and charged at Tiyan, trying to kill him. Vyriel tried to de-escalate the fight and ended up with his hands bound, managing to force himself between Tiyan and Lucia. Mālwa intimidated everone by making the whole stone room resonate with his heartbeat, causing Tiyan to flee deeper into the temple.</p>

												<p>Vyriel then turned into a hawk and fled, following Seilon. After knocking out one of the Sinless with a single punch, Mālwa slew two of them - stabbing a man through the chest from behind and beheading a woman - so Lucia would be able to leave. They then fled together.</p>

												<p>The party returned to find Sinless at the inn where they were staying. They found Bihen, the librarian Seilon had seen earlier, trying to get their belongings out while the innkeeper stalled the Divine who came with the Sinless.</p>

												<p>The party escaped with Bihen and their belongings and fled into the jungle.</p>

												<p>Bihen helped the party sneak back into Turuvan. He stabled their horses at the same inn, as the owner is a close friend of his, and hid the group in hidden rooms beneath his library.</p>

												<p>They spent the day in research. Bihen made a heavily annotated copy of their prophecy - he had an incomplete copy that was missing the central stanza. Seilon deciphered the rest of Arness' scrolls. Lucia memorised maps of the nearby area. Vyriel read up on the Vaults. Mālwa kept an eye out for anyone trying to find them.</p>

												<p>High Divine Tiyan returned as the Angel Tiravus and issued his proclamation: every time the bells of the temple ring, his Sinless Divines will each take one of the citizens and free them of their sins.</p>

												<p>The party intervened in one of the first of these events, killing the Divine and knocking both the Sinless that accompanied them unconscious.</p>

												<p>Lucia tried to convince a group of terrified citizens that they should rise up and resist this. She had some limited success, but they were hesitant to resist the Divines and put off by the fact that Saelon had murdered one (the first time he'd ever killed) in front of them.</p>

												<p>Bihen gave the party a list of names of community leaders - some dissidents and some more devout - and where they could be found. The party wants to use this to raise a rebellion.</p>

												<p>They first sought out the dissident Brook Tolarod in the sewers, who agreed to accompany them.</p>

												<p>Vyriel spoke with Drevutal, and told him that he would choose the guardians' side in the coming conflict. Drevutal gave no straight answers, but said a cost was involved in having to save his people from their prophecised doom and doubted Vyriel could "make a traitor of" his friend.</p>

												<p>The rest of the party sought Thasha, the merchant, who has maps of the caves and agreed to provide arms and hired muscle. The bell tolled during the meeting, and Seilon led a charge out to save a potential abductee in the next street.</p>

												<p>They found Ilar, and convinced him to help them. He mentioned that the original Sinless came from the people he was sheltering.</p>

												<p>The party cordoned off a city block in the southeastern area of the city, taking over a couple of inns and using their contacts to offer shelter. They build barricades, Thasha brought in weapons and guards, and Vyriel returned.</p>

												<p>Saelon managed to replicate Arness' goggles, a magic item that lets him see into the ethereal plane (requires attunement).</p>

												<p>Lucia used Find Steed to summon Durian, a dire wolf mount with eyes like hers and slightly colour-shifting fur.</p>

												<p>Saelon finished constructing Leonidas, a quickling mechanical servant.</p>

												<p>In the morning, two Sinless went to watch the barricade. They were weak and sickly. Lucia delved into one's mind and saw that they've had something removed, and might be saved if it is returned. Saelon's detect magic felt a weak force driving them, that should be easy to resist. Lucia's Command took effect, but wore off after several seconds.</p>

												<p>Durian was commanded to return the Sinless woman Lucia had delved into to the temple, though if he ran into any aggression he was to leave her and return to the cordon.</p>

												<p>The 7 o'clock bell (second of the day) rang while they were investigating the Sinless, but they didn't notice any abductions.</p>

												<p>Mernivont tried to pull them into the spirits' halfway realm, but they noticed the effects and left in case it was malicious. Later, when it seemed persistent, they let it happen as though it were a trap. Mernivont explained himself, and asked their help in dealing with Tiyan so that he might be saved. He also revealed to the party that the spirits perceived them to be a group of five, with Doyamin included.</p>

												<p>Mernivont teleported the group into the caves behind the temple. They found the vault entrance and incapacitated a sinless there. Further in, they were noticed when Mālwa kicked a set of keys accidentally and they fell down steps. Lucia slew the sinless divines who came out into the hallway to see what the noise was, and the group fled into the prayer room and barricaded the door.</p>

												<p>Mernivont had imprinted on them the layout of the vault, so they knew they could find their way quickly from the high divine's quarters to the Sin Archive, where Tiravus would be waiting. They did this, sneaking through the back of the courtroom, to confront Tiravus below.</p>

												<p>At the end of a hard fight, Saelon stood ready to pull Birthright's trigger and kill Tiravus, but a look from Vyriel stopped him and he instead incapacitated the self-proclaimed angel. Vyriel had to move fast to prevent Lucia from finishing the job, until Mernivont appeared.</p>

												<p>Mernivont asked for a willing conduit for Tiyan's sins. Vyriel looked at his friends, he saw Mālwa's ongoing issues with Doyamin, Lucia's rash violence and already troubled past, and his friend Saelon who had already taken on so many new burdens. So he offered himself. During the process, Vyriel lost his grip on his sense of self, and was nearly scoured away by the torrent of sin. In the end, some memories of horrible deeds remain as though they were his own, while Mernivont spirited away Tiyan's body.</p>

												<p>They freed the prisoners from the vault, and Saelon figured out their restraints and was able to create four magical tethers. Mālwa, still injured, rested for the remainder of the day</p>

												<p>Vyriel wandered off to the temple on his own to seek Mernivont's guidance, though he found no answer. Lucia followed after him, and found the boy who rings the temple bell. Both Vyriel and Lucia slept in the temple, and were awakened by Bihen trying to sneak past them into the vault.</p>

												<p>They convinced him not to, though they didn't manage to convince him that it's dangerous. He made them promise to take him with them when they next went in.</p>

												<p>Vyriel remembered, through Tiravus' memories, that if someone's extracted sins could be returned to them they might recover.</p>

												<p>Mālwa had a dream about Oyado. He stood atop the tower with Ayodelle's status and saw new people had come to it, and heard Dato say "We couldn't stay forgotten forever". Something about those words seemed familiar to him. At the end of his dream, he saw Ayodelle's hair blow in the wing.</p>

												<p>They spent the day cataloguing the sins. They rescued 6 people, including a thief called Nik who had stolen high value items including some from Thasha. Nik begged them to save her sister Ilin, but they never found her sin.</p>

												<p>7 others they didn't save, as they were murderers or rapists. Of the 43 vials Vyriel identified as being placed after the vault was reopened, 13 were found that belonged to people that were still alive.</p>

												</p>Lucia's memories were restored, Vyriel fed one sinless a vial-full from the well that restored them but shattered their mind, like a handful of gravel where they need a stone.</p>

												<p>Bihen secretly took one of the vials, to send north to Jerga with his report, while the others were busy at the well.</p>

												<p>Saelon found the vial containing Thriss Maradan's genocide, and secretly kept it at the end. It was his decision not to save the rapists and murderers.</p>

												<p>Mālwa built a solid rock wall to seal off the vault, and they asked Ilar to make sure no one entered it until Iluka or Mernivont came. The bodies of the sinless had already been removed before this.</p>

												<p>They arrived at Taramal in the afternoon, and saw its guardians from a distance.</p>

												<p>Saelon researched archeology of Toridal, found that the temples had been reclaimed with no record of their being built and towns or cities were built around them, except Taramal which has an unbroken history (never claimed by jungle) and therefore records of its building.</p>

												<p>He also researched the genocide of Thriss Maradan, who 300 or so years ago took a small group of followers and killed hundreds of people of a certain ethnic group in Toridal. They used magic to do their killing, and this aspect of Toridalin history has cemented their fear and hatred of arcane magic.</p>

												<ul>
													<li>There is a third mural in the eastern prayer hall, on the ceiling. The two murals on the wall clearly depict Avamoth and Barahm, but the mural on the ceiling is like a white rope, coiled and knotted endlessly. What is it? (The eastern prayer hall is one of the oldest parts of the temple)</li>
													<li>The cleansing rains have fallen on Taramal on the same day every year for as long as Taramal's history, and maybe longer. Why? What brings them?</li>
													<li>High Divine Iluka of Lodiran was expected to arrive in Taramal a few days ago, but hasn't. Nearby villages have seen her pass through with others, gathering more as she went, but the chronology of rumours shows her group dwindling in size when it should be growing. Where is she and what happened to her?</li>
													<li>At the ends of their respective lives, the Divine Mother and Divine Father each travel past an ancient seal in Taramal Temple. Why? What's behind that seal?</li>
												</ul>

												<p>They snuck into the temple, magically disguised as divines and led by Sara (Saelon is invisible with mouse Vyriel in his pocket). In a secluded divine-only area, they found a mural of the white rope thing that ended with a clear reconstruction. Behind that wall, they found the original mural had continued along a now blocked off corridor, and ended in the head of a snake. The snake was looking at something enclosed in a many-pointed star, but whatever was inside it had been worn away.</p>

												<p>Using Synaut, they saw a child divine being forced by an angry and near-violent adult divine to scrub away the cross-legged man within the star from the mural.</p>

												<p>They then searched deeper into the temple and eventually found the large metal seal. Saelon thinks the mechanism for opening it must be magical, probably known to the divines. The chamber it is in is open to the sky, at a nexus of various halls. Each hall has channels leading down towards the seal, where they join it and end in small drainage holes. The seal itself is in a lower surface, with a ring of steps surrounding the platform that it is on. Lucia saw shimmering colours running along the channels in the seal itself.</p>
